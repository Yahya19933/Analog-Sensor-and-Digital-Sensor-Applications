# Analog-Sensor-and-Digital-Sensor-Applications
Examples of analog sensor and digital sensor  applications using Arduino


## Analog sensor pplications
Analog sensors output a variable voltage and resistance as they are activated. The most generic type of analog sensor is a potentiometer, and more specific types include flex sensors, photoresistors, microphones, some temperature sensors

1. **Temperature Sensor**

 Temperature detector, that provides temperature measurement in a readable form through an electrical signal

2. **Gas Sensor**

Gas sensors are devices that can detect the presence and concentration of various hazardous gases and vapors, such as toxic or explosive gases

3. **Photoresistors LDR Sensor**

Photoresistors, also known as light dependent resistors (LDR), are light sensitive devices most often used to indicate the presence or absence of light, or to measure the light intensity. In the dark, their resistance is very high, sometimes up to 1 MΩ, but when the LDR sensor is exposed to light, the resistance drops dramatically, even down to a few ohms, depending on the light intensity

## Digital sensor pplications
Digital Sensors produce a discrete digital output signals or voltages that are a digital representation of the quantity being measured. Digital sensors produce a Binary output signal in the form of a logic “1” or a logic “0”, (“ON” or “OFF”). Some sensors in this category include pushbuttons, switches, tilt balls sensors, magnetic reed switches, PIR motion sensors, and vibration switche

1. **Ultrasonic Sensor**

Ultrasonic Sensors measure the distance to the target by measuring the time between the emission and reception. An optical sensor has a transmitter and receiver, whereas an ultrasonic sensor uses a single ultrasonic element for both emission and reception

2. **PIR Motion Sensor**

PIR sensors allow you to sense motion, almost always used to detect whether a human has moved in or out of the sensors range

3. **Keypad Security Door Lock**

By makeing the Password-Based Security System Using Arduino & Keypad. The digital code lock can secure your home or locker easily. It will open your door only when the right password is entered
