# Analog-Sensor-and-Digital-Sensor-Applications
Examples of analog sensor and digital sensor  applications using Arduino


## Analog sensor pplications
Analog sensors output a variable voltage and resistance as they are activated. The most generic type of analog sensor is a potentiometer, and more specific types include flex sensors, photoresistors, microphones, some temperature sensors, and more

1. **Temperature Sensor**

 temperature detector, that provides temperature measurement in a readable form through an electrical signal

2. **Gas Sensor**
Gas sensors are devices that can detect the presence and concentration of various hazardous gases and vapors, such as toxic or explosive gases

3. **Photoresistors LDR Sensor**
Photoresistors, also known as light dependent resistors (LDR), are light sensitive devices most often used to indicate the presence or absence of light, or to measure the light intensity. In the dark, their resistance is very high, sometimes up to 1 MÎ©, but when the LDR sensor is exposed to light, the resistance drops dramatically, even down to a few ohms, depending on the light intensity
