Examples of analog sensor and digital sensor  applications using Arduino


## Analog sensor pplications
Analog sensors output a variable voltage and resistance as they are activated. The most generic type of analog sensor is a potentiometer, and more specific types include flex sensors, photoresistors, microphones, some temperature sensors, and more
